This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's course "Getting and Cleaning data", available at www.coursera.org

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

Unpack the data into the subfolder labelled "data".

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses.

The output of the 5th step is called `data_out`.
